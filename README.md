# Movie Recommendation System

In today's fast-paced world, recommendation systems play a crucial role in assisting users with making informed choices, saving their cognitive resources.

## Introduction

This project aims to develop a movie recommendation system utilizing machine learning techniques. By analyzing user preferences and movie characteristics, the system provides personalized recommendations tailored to individual tastes.

## Technologies Used

- **Numpy**: For numerical computations and data manipulation.
- **Pandas**: For data analysis and manipulation.
- **scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
- **Streamlit**: For building interactive web applications for deploying the recommendation system.

## Dataset

The project utilizes the TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset, which contains information about thousands of movies. The dataset provides valuable features such as movie ratings, genres, and cast information, essential for building an effective recommendation engine.
